## Introduction to Python
### The history of Python
1. Christmas in 1989: Guido von Rossum began writing a compiler for Python.
2. February 1991: The first Python compiler (also an interpreter) was born. 
It was implemented in C (behind) and could call C library functions. 
In the earliest version, Python has provided support for building blocks such as "classes", "functions", and "exception handling", 
as well as core data types such as lists and dictionaries. It also supports building applications based on modules .
3. January 1994: Python 1.0 was officially released.
4. October 16, 2000: Python 2.0 was released, adding complete garbage collection and providing support for Unicode . At the same time, the entire development process of Python is more transparent, the community's influence on the development progress is gradually expanding, and the ecosystem is slowly forming.
5. December 3, 2008: Python 3.0 was released. It is not fully compatible with the previous Python code, but because there are still many companies using Python 2.x versions in projects and operations, Python 3.x has many new The features were later ported to Python 2.6 / 2.7.
The version of Python 3.7.x that we currently use was released in 2018. 

The version number of Python is divided into three sections, shaped like ABC. Where A is the major version number, generally when the overall rewrite, or there is a change that is not backward compatible, increase A; B means a function update, add B when a new function appears; C means a small change (for example: repair a certain Bug), add C as long as there is a modification. If you are interested in the history of Python, you can read a web article called "A Brief History of Python" .


### Advantages and disadvantages of Python
The advantages of Python are many, simple can be summarized as the following points.

1. Simple and clear, with a low learning curve, it is easier to get started than many programming languages.
2. Open source code, with a strong community and ecosystem, especially in the field of data analysis and machine learning.
3. The interpreted language is inherently platform-portable, and the code can work on different operating systems.
4. Support for two mainstream programming paradigms (object-oriented programming and functional programming).
5. The code is highly standardized and readable, and is suitable for people with code cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The shortcomings of Python are mainly concentrated in the following points.

1. The execution efficiency is slightly lower, and the parts that require high execution efficiency can be written in other languages ​​(such as C, C ++).
2. The code cannot be encrypted, but now many companies do not sell software but sell services, this problem will be weakened.
3. There are too many frameworks that can be selected during development (for example, there are more than 100 web frameworks), and there are errors in the choices.


### Applications of Python
At present, Python has a wide range of applications in the fields of web application back-end development, cloud infrastructure construction, DevOps, network data collection (crawler), automated testing, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Install the Python interpreter

To start a Python programming journey, you must first install the Python interpreter environment on the computer you use. The following will take the installation of the official Python interpreter as an example to explain how to install the Python environment on different operating systems. The official Python interpreter is implemented in C and is also the most widely used Python interpreter, usually called CPython. In addition, the Python interpreter has Jython implemented in Java, IronPython implemented in C #, and versions such as PyPy, Brython, and Pyston. Interested readers can understand it by themselves.

### Windows environment
The Windows installer (exe file) of Python can be downloaded from the Python official website . It should be noted that if you install Python 3.x in the Windows 7 environment, you need to install the Service Pack 1 patch package (you can automatically install the system through some tool software The function of the patch is installed), the installation process is recommended to check "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (add Python 3.x to the PATH environment variable) and select a custom installation, it is best to set "Optional Features" interface " "pip", "tcl / tk", "Python test suite" and other items are all checked. It is strongly recommended to choose a custom installation path and ensure that there is no Chinese in the path. After the installation is complete, you will see a "Setup was successful" prompt. If you run the Python program later and there is a problem that the Python interpreter cannot work because some dynamic link library files are missing, you can solve it according to the following methods.

If the system shows that the api-ms-win-crt * .dll file is missing, you can refer to the "api-ms-win-crt * .dll missing cause analysis and solution" article to deal with the method explained or download Visual C ++ directly on the Microsoft official website Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 files to be repaired; if it is due to the problem of missing some dynamic link library files after updating DirectX for Windows, you can download a DirectX repair tool to repair.

### Linux environment
The Linux environment comes with the Python 2.x version, but if you want to update to the 3.x version, you can download the Python source code on the Python official website and install it through the source code build and installation method. (Take CentOS as an example).

1. Install dependent libraries (because without these dependent libraries may fail due to missing underlying dependent libraries during the installation of source code components).

```bash
yum -y install wget gcc zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel libffi-devel
```

2. Download the Python source code and unzip it to the specified directory.

```
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/Python-3.7.6.tar.xz
xz -d Python-3.7.6.tar.xz
tar -xvf Python-3.7.6.tar
```

3. Switch to the Python source code directory and execute the following commands to configure and install.

```
cd Python-3.7.6
./configure --prefix = / usr / local / python37 --enable-optimizations
make && make install
```

4. Modify the file named .bash_profile in the user's home directory, configure the PATH environment variable and make it effective.

```
cd  ~ 
vim .bash_profile
```

```
# ... Omit the above code here ...

export PATH = $ PATH : / usr / local / python37 / bin

# ... The following code is omitted here ...
```

5. Activate environment variables.

```
source .bash_profile
```

### macOS environment
macOS also comes with Python 2.x version, you can install Python 3.x version through the installation file (pkg file) provided by Python's official website . After the default installation is complete, you can pythonstart the 2.x version of the Python interpreter by executing commands in the terminal. You need to execute the command to start the 3.x version of the Python interpreter python3.

## Run Python program

### Confirm Python version
You can type the following command in the Windows command line prompt.

```
python --version
```

Type the following command in the terminal of Linux or macOS system.
```
python3 --version
```

Of course, you can also enter pythonor python3enter the interactive environment, and then execute the following code to check the Python version.

```
import  sys

print ( sys . version_info )
print ( sys . version )
```


### Write Python source code
You can use a text editing tool (recommended to use Sublime , Visual Studio Code and other advanced text editing tools) to write Python source code and save the file with py as the suffix. The code content is shown below.

```
print ( 'hello, world!' )
```

### Run the program
Switch to the directory where the source code is located and execute the following command to see if "hello, world!" Is output on the screen.

```
python hello.py
```

or

```
python3 hello.py
```

### Comments in the code
Comments are an important part of the programming language. They are used to explain the role of the code in the source code to enhance the readability and maintainability of the program. Of course, you can also remove the code segments that do not need to participate in the source code through comments This is often used when debugging programs. The comment will be removed when entering the preprocessor or compiling with the source code, and will not be retained in the target code or affect the execution result of the program.

1. Single-line comments-sections beginning with # and spaces
2. Multi-line comments-three quotation marks at the beginning and three quotation marks at the end

```
"""The 
first Python program-hello, world! 
Tribute to the great Mr. Dennis M. Ritchie

Version: 0.1 
Author: Luo Hao 
"""
 
print ( 'hello, world!' )

 # Print (" Hello, world! ")
```

##Python development tools
## IDLE-comes with integrated development tools

IDLE is an integrated development tool that comes with the Python environment installed, as shown in the following figure. However, because IDLE's user experience is not so good, it is rarely used in actual development.

## IPython-better interactive programming tool
IPython is an interactive interpreter based on Python. Compared with the native Python interactive environment, IPython provides more powerful editing and interactive functions. You can install IPython through Python's package management tool pip. The specific operations are as follows.

```
pip install ipython
```

or

```
pip3 install ipython
```

After the installation is successful, you can start IPython through the following ipython command, as shown below.


## PyCharm-Python development artifact
The installation, configuration and use of PyCharm are introduced in "Playing with PyCharm" , and interested readers can choose to read it.

## Exercise
1. Enter the following code in the Python interactive environment and view the results, please try to translate the content you see into Chinese.
```
import  this
```

| Note : Enter the code above, and you can see the "Zen of Python" written by Tim Peter in the interactive environment of Python. The truth in it is not only applicable to Python, but also applicable to other programming languages.

2. Learn to use turtle to draw graphics on the screen.

Description : Turtle is a very interesting module built into Python, which is especially suitable for small partners who have a first experience in computer programming. It was originally part of the Logo language, which was a programming language invented by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.

```
import  turtle

turtle . pensize ( 4 )
turtle . pencolor ( 'red' )

turtle . forward ( 100 )
turtle . right ( 90 )
turtle . forward ( 100 )
turtle . right ( 90 )
turtle . forward ( 100 )
turtle . right ( 90 )
turtle . forward ( 100 )

turtle . mainloop ()
```

| Tip : The code provided in this chapter also includes the code for drawing the national flag and the piggy page. Interested readers please study by yourself.
